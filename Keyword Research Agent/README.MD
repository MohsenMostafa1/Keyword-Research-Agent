🔍 Keyword Research API: Smarter Insights with Google Trends

In the world of digital marketing, SEO, and content creation, understanding what people are searching for is gold. However, raw keyword suggestions from tools like Google Trends often require heavy filtering, manual validation, and statistical cleanup.

To solve this, we’ve built an advanced Keyword Research Agent using FastAPI that wraps Google Trends into a smart, reliable, and developer-friendly API. Here's how it works and why it's powerful:
🚀 What Does It Do?

This API automates the keyword research process by:

    ✅ Fetching keyword suggestions from Google Trends

    🔍 Filtering results based on relevance scores

    📉 Removing outliers (statistical anomalies)

    🔁 Caching results to reduce redundant API calls

    🧪 Verifying the consistency and quality of keyword results over multiple runs

It provides two main endpoints:

    POST /keywords: Returns a curated list of trending, relevant keywords

    POST /keywords/verify: Analyzes keyword stability over repeated fetches to ensure quality

💡 Why Is This Useful?

    Automated Filtering: Not all keyword suggestions are useful. This agent applies intelligent validation rules to give you only high-quality data.

    Noise Reduction: It removes data points with statistically abnormal volumes or low relevance, helping avoid misleading trends.

    Reliability Checks: By verifying keyword sets across multiple runs, it can flag unstable or inconsistent queries.

    Developer-Ready: With FastAPI and Pydantic under the hood, it provides clear documentation, fast responses, and robust input validation.

    Optimized for Real Use: Implements caching, retries, and error handling to work reliably in production environments.

🧪 Example Use Cases

    SEO Tools: Enrich your platform with cleaner, smarter keyword suggestions.

    Content Strategy: Identify trending topics with proven relevance and stable interest.

    Marketing Dashboards: Integrate real-time keyword analytics into custom dashboards.

🛠️ Tech Stack Highlights

    FastAPI: For high-performance API delivery

    Google Trends (pytrends): As the core data provider

    Pydantic: For robust request validation

    Statistics & Caching: To ensure result accuracy and performance

This agent takes the guesswork out of keyword research—making your tools smarter and your strategies sharper.

Let your team, clients, or app users search smarter, not harder.
